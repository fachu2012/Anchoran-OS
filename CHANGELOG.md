## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-11

First pre-release build, meant for hands-on testing of the full desktop
experience end to end (boot → desktop → apps → lock/power → exit).

### Added

- Initial project scaffold: Electron + React + TypeScript + Vite.
- Core architecture: WindowManager, Desktop, Applications, Components, Theme, Settings, FileSystem, Terminal, Notifications, Assets.
- Fullscreen kiosk shell base (frameless, immersive window).
- Boot screen with Anchoran identity.
- Light/Dark theme system with configurable accent color.
- Centralized WindowManager: open/close/focus/minimize/maximize/move/resize, drag-to-move, drag-to-resize.
- Eight built-in applications: Files, Terminal, Settings, Notes, Calculator, Browser, System Monitor, App Center.
- Anchoran Launcher (search + open apps + Settings/Power), opened from the dock, system bar, or the Windows key where Electron can register it.
- Running-windows strip in the system bar acting as Anchoran's task switcher, including restoring minimized windows.
- Full notification system: toasts plus a persistent notification panel (history, dismiss, clear all).
- Lock screen and Power menu (Lock, Sleep, Restart Anchoran, Shut Down Anchoran), plus the "Exit Anchoran?" confirmation on any normal close attempt.
- Anchoran's own virtual filesystem (Files app + Terminal), fully separate from the host Windows filesystem.
- Single-source SemVer versioning (`version.json`) synced into build metadata, shown in Settings → About and `anchoran version`.
- Placeholder assets for the logo and executable icon pending final design; all other iconography and the default wallpaper are code-generated (no emojis, no raster placeholders needed).
- Reproducible build producing `AnchoranOS.exe` via `electron-builder` (NSIS).

### Known limitations in this pre-release

- The installer is currently electron-builder's default NSIS wizard, not the custom fullscreen branded installer planned for the 1.0.0 release (see README roadmap).
- The Browser app embeds sites via `<iframe>`; sites that block framing will show blank.
- The Anchoran logo is a placeholder; the executable icon is a blank placeholder `.ico`.
